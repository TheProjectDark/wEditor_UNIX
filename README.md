wEditor is a free and open-source text and code editor written with C++ using wxWidgets library.
This application is my own pet-project which is mostly priorited for UNIX-like systems.

There are the instruction how tu build up a project from source code:
1. Make sure to install wxWidgets library. I personally recommend you to build it up from source code. Following this guide:
   https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.3/plat_osx_install.html
   (It is for macOS, but also works on Linux)
2. Make sure to install clang (you can also use another compiler, but you need to change Makefile for your compiler)
3. Compile the app using command make
